# Java---Choco---Multi-Objective-Constraint-Programming-for-Diplomatic-Seating-Optimisation
Modelled a real-world seating/transport problem in Java using the Choco constraint solver with diplomatic incompatibility constraints.  

The below was the problem that the code files solve:

A certain President want to create a Council of Very Important Countries to discuss world affairs. The countries will send one delegate each, who will fly to a local airport, and then once all have arrived they will be taken by car to the President's hotel for the council meeting. But the number of cars is limited, and so delegates must share the cars. Some pairs of countries do not have diplomatic relations with each other, and so cannot sit in the same car. All countries are asked to make a large donation to support the work of the council, and each country has indicated how much they are willing to donate. 

The president would like to know:

(i) can we find seats for all the countries in the cars?

(ii) what is the minimum number of cars that are needed?

(iii) if the number of cars is strictly limited, what countries should be invited to ensure they can all fit in the cars, and so that the total value of donations is maximised?
