# Java---Choco---Multi-Objective-Constraint-Programming-for-Diplomatic-Seating-Optimisation
Modelled a real-world seating/transport problem in Java using the Choco constraint solver with diplomatic incompatibility constraints.  Implemented a CP solution to: (1) check feasibility and output seating, (2) minimise number of cars, and (3) maximise total donations under a car limit.
